Title: Eye Movement Project

Description: In JavaScript, events are actions that happen on a web page. 
They can be anything from a mouse moving to a user typing in some text. Events happen to most elements on the Document Object Modeling (DOM). 
These events are a good way to bind a code to user actions. For example, consider a web page that has a form with a "Submit" button. 

How to run road map: In this project exercise we  can bind the mouse button click to that button and submit the form data upon that click. Mouse events are a popular way to bind the DOM elements to events. Some of these events are as follows: click, mousemove and mouseleave. 
We added a second eye element and had that element followed the mouse position on the screen using the mouse events
